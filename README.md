Where Inspiration meets Creativity! This is an app to hold all crafting ( mainly sewing right now) related needs virtually.

### Difficulties:

The hardest part for me was the foreign key table, getting it to show up correctly in the View, without all the information from all the tables was challenging. 

I also had problems with my bootstrap file, but after taking a break, I figured it out fairly quickly!

### Future Plans:

I will most likely keep working on this project and keep updating it. I would love to have an actual working app that people can use. When I first thought of a sewing app, I went to one of many sewing groups on good ol' Facebook and asked what their perfect dream sewing app would be able to do, to which I got about 200 user stories from, so I have many things on the list to add! Plus it will keep me sharp to keep coming back and improving upon it!
